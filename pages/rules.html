						<h2>GAME ACTIONS</h2>
						<p>
							This section describes the actions that you’ll take during a game,
							including tapping your cards, casting spells, and attacking and
							blocking with creatures in combat.
						</p>
						<div class="game-actions-info">
							<div class="tapping">
								<h3>TAPPING AND UNTAPPING</h3>
								<p>
									To tap a card is to turn it sideways to show that it has been
									used for the turn. You do this when you use a land to make
									mana, when you attack with a creature, or when you activate an
									ability that has the symbol as part of its cost ( means "tap
									this permanent"). When a permanent is tapped, you can’t tap it
									again until it’s been untapped (turned back upright). As your
									turn begins, untap your tapped cards so you can use them
									again.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="casting">
								<h3>CASTING SPELLS</h3>
								<p>
									To cast a spell, you must pay its mana cost (located in the
									upper right corner of the card) by tapping lands (or other
									permanents) to make the amount and Game Actions type of mana
									which that spell requires. For example, if you were casting
									Serra Angel, which costs , you could tap three basic lands of
									any type to pay plus two Plains to pay .
								</p>
								<p>
									Once a spell has been cast, one of two things happens. If the
									spell is an instant or a sorcery, you follow the instructions
									on the card, and then you put the card into your graveyard. If
									the spell is a creature, artifact, or enchantment, you put the
									card on the table in front of you. The card is now on the
									battlefield.
								</p>
								<p>
									Cards on the battlefield are called permanents to
									differentiate them from instants and sorceries, which are
									never on the battlefield.
								</p>
								<div class="casting-img">
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-01.png" alt="#" />
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="attacking">
								<h3>ATTACKING AND BLOCKING</h3>
								<p>
									The most common way to win the game is to attack with your
									creatures. If a creature that is attacking an opponent isn’t
									blocked, it deals damage equal to its power to that opponent.
								</p>
								<p>
									The middle phase of each turn is the combat phase. In your
									combat phase, you choose which of your creatures will attack,
									and you choose which opponents they will attack. Tap your
									creatures to show that they are attacking. Your opponents then
									choose which of their creatures will block, if any. Tapped
									creatures can’t be declared as blockers.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once all blockers have been chosen, each creature—both
									attackers and blockers—simultaneously deals damage equal to
									its power (the number on the left side of the slash in the
									lower right corner of the card).
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										An attacking creature that isn’t blocked deals damage to the
										player it’s attacking.
									</li>
									<li>
										An attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to the
										creature or creatures that are blocking it, and vice versa.
									</li>
									<li>
										If damage is dealt to your opponent, they lose that much
										life.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									If one of your attacking creatures is blocked by multiple
									creatures, you decide how to divide its combat damage among
									them. You must assign at least enough damage to the first
									blocking creature to destroy it before you can assign damage
									to the second one, and so on.
								</p>
								<p>
									If a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than its
									toughness over the course of a single turn (whether it be
									combat damage, damage from spells or abilities, or a
									combination of both), that creature is destroyed, and it goes
									to its owner’s graveyard (or "dies"). If a creature takes
									damage that isn’t enough to destroy it in a single turn, that
									creature stays on the battlefield, and the damage wears off at
									the end of the turn.
								</p>
								<div class="attacking-img">
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-02-01.png" alt="#" />
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-02-02.png" alt="#" />
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-02-03.png" alt="#" />
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-02-04.png" alt="#" />
								</div>
								<p>
									In this example, Dwarven Priest is attacking, and you have two
									creatures that can block. When you block one attacker with two
									or more creatures, your opponent must choose the order in
									which your blockers will take damage. Remember, the attacking
									player always chooses the order in which blocking creatures
									receive damage.
								</p>
								<p>
									Reclamation Sage and Giant Spider will deal a total of 4
									damage to Dwarven Priest, which is enough to destroy it.
									Meanwhile, Dwarven Priest can deal enough damage to destroy
									Reclamation Sage, but not enough to destroy Giant Spider.
									Since your opponent’s Dwarven Priest will be destroyed in
									either case, they order Reclamation Sage before Giant Spider
									so that at least one of your creatures will be destroyed.
								</p>
								<div class="attacking-img last-img">
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-03.png" alt="#" />
								</div>
								<p>
									Once blockers have been ordered, damage is dealt. Dwarven
									Priest deals 1 damage to Reclamation Sage, destroying it, then
									deals its remaining 1 damage to Giant Spider.
								</p>

						<h2>ADVANCED TOPICS</h2>
						<p>
							One of the most fun and interesting aspects of the Magic game is
							the tremendous number of unique cards you can play with, which in
							turn provide an incredibly wide range of things that could happen
							in any given game. This section is a reference for when you need
							to know more details about the rules of Magic.
						</p>
						<div class="advanced-topics-info">
							<h3>TARGETING</h3>
							<p>
								Some spells and abilities use the word "target" to describe
								something that the spell or ability will affect. You must choose
								all targets for a spell when you cast it, and for an ability
								when it triggers or when you activate it. If you can’t meet the
								targeting requirements, you can’t cast the spell or use the
								ability. For example, if a spell has the text "Destroy target
								creature," but there are no creatures on the battlefield, you
								can’t cast that spell because it has no valid targets.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a spell "deals damage to any target," you can choose any
								creature or player (or planeswalker, if a player has one) as a
								target for that spell.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once you choose targets, you can’t change your mind later. When
								the spell or ability resolves, it checks the targets to make
								sure they’re still legal (that is, they’re still there and they
								still match the requirements of the spell or ability). If a
								target isn’t legal, the spell or ability can’t affect it. If
								none of the targets are legal, the spell or ability does nothing
								at all.
							</p>
							<h3 class="stack">THE STACK</h3>
							<p>
								The stack is a game zone shared by all players (like the
								battlefield) where spells and abilities wait to resolve.
								Resolving a spell or ability simply means that its effect
								happens.
							</p>
							<div class="stack-info">
								<h4>USING THE STACK</h4>
								<p>
									When you cast a spell or activate an ability, it doesn’t
									resolve right away—it goes on the stack. Spells and abilities
									remain on the stack until both players choose not to cast any
									new spells or activate any new abilities. Triggered abilities
									also go on the stack until they resolve.
								</p>
								<p>
									When you have finished putting spells and abilities on the
									stack, priority then passes to the next player in turn order,
									who may want to use a spell or ability of their own in
									response. Subsequent players (including you) can then respond
									to that player’s response, and so on—the result is a "stack"
									waiting to resolve. Spells and abilities remain on the stack
									until all players choose not to cast any new spells or
									activate any new abilities.
								</p>
								<p>
									<em
										>A general rule is that spells and abilities on the stack
										resolve one by one, beginning with the last one put on the
										stack.</em
									>
								</p>
								<h4>RESPONDING TO SPELLS AND ABILITIES</h4>
								<p>
									When you cast a spell or activate an ability, it doesn’t
									resolve right away—it goes on the stack. Spells and abilities
									remain on the stack until both players choose not to cast any
									new spells or activate any new abilities. Triggered abilities
									also go on the stack until they resolve.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each player has an opportunity to cast an instant spell (or
									activate an activated ability) in response to any spell or
									ability that goes on the stack. If a player does decide to
									respond, their spell or ability goes on the stack on top of
									what was already waiting there. When all players pass—that is,
									decline to do anything more—the top spell or ability on the
									stack will resolve.
								</p>
								<div class="stack-img">
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-04.png" alt="#" />
								</div>
								<p>
									After a spell or ability resolves, both players again get the
									chance to respond. If no one does, the next thing waiting on
									the stack will resolve. If the stack is empty, the current
									step of the turn will end, and the game will proceed to the
									next step.
								</p>
								<h4>EXAMPLE OF SPELLS ON THE STACK</h4>
								<p>
									Your opponent casts Shock targeting your Eager Construct, a
									2/2 creature. Shock goes on the stack. You respond to Shock by
									casting Titanic Growth. Titanic Growth goes on the stack on
									top of Shock. You and your opponent both decline to do
									anything else.
								</p>
								<p>
									Your opponent casts Shock targeting your Eager Construct, a
									2/2 creature. Shock goes on the stack. You respond to Shock by
									casting Titanic Growth. Titanic Growth goes on the stack on
									top of Shock. You and your opponent both decline to do
									anything else.
								</p>
								<p>
									Titanic Growth resolves, making Eager Construct a 6/6 until
									the end of the turn. Then Shock resolves and deals 2 damage to
									the pumped-up Eager Construct, which is not enough to destroy
									it.
								</p>
								<div class="stack-img">
									<img src="../assets/images/rules/rules-05.png" alt="#" />
								</div>
								<p>
									<b>What would happen if Titanic Growth were cast first?</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									The Shock would go on the stack on top of Titanic Growth,
									which means it would resolve first this time. Shock would
									still deal 2 damage to Eager Construct, but this time that
									damage is being dealt before Titanic Growth can resolve and
									take effect—so 2 damage is enough to destroy Eager Construct!

					<h1>PARTS OF THE TURN</h1>
					<p>
						Each turn proceeds in the same sequence. Whenever you enter a new
						step or phase, any triggered abilities that happen during that step
						or phase trigger and are put on the stack. The active player (the
						player whose turn it is) gets to start casting spells and activating
						abilities, then each other player in turn order will too. When all
						players decline to do anything more and nothing is on the stack
						waiting to resolve, the game will move to the next step.

								<li>
									<span>Untap step:</span> You untap all your tapped permanents.

									number of cards. If something is supposed to happen just once
									per turn, right at the beginning, an ability will trigger "at
									the beginning of your upkeep."
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Draw step:</span> You must draw a card from your library
									(even if you don’t want to). The player who goes first in a

							<h2>COMBAT STEP</h2>

								<li>
									<span>Declare attackers step:</span> You decide which, if any,
									of your untapped creatures will attack, and which player or
									planeswalker they will attack. This taps the attacking
									creatures. Players can then cast instants and activate
									abilities.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Declare blockers step:</span> Your opponent decides
									which, if any, of their untapped creatures will block your
									attacking creatures. If multiple creatures block a single
									attacker, you order the blockers to show which will be first
									to receive damage, which will be second, and so on. Players
									can then cast instants and activate abilities.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Combat damage step:</span> Each attacking or blocking
									creature that’s still on the battlefield assigns its combat
									damage to the defending player (if it’s attacking that player
									and wasn’t blocked), to a planeswalker (if it’s attacking that
									planeswalker and wasn’t blocked), to the creature or creatures
									blocking it, or to the creature it’s blocking. If an attacking
									creature is blocked by multiple creatures, you divide its
									combat damage among them by assigning at least enough damage
									to the first blocking creature to destroy it, then by
									assigning damage to the second one, and so on. Once players
									decide how the creatures they control will deal their combat
									damage, the damage is all dealt at the same time. Players can

								<h3>PLAY RULES & MODIFIERS</h3>
								<p>
									This format is for four players per game and deck sizes are 99
									cards + 1 commander card. The game duration for this format
									should be about 20 minutes per player.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Commander format is all about picking your hero and
									building a deck around them. In this casual, multiplayer
									format, you choose a legendary creature to serve as your
									commander and build the rest of your deck around their color
									identity and unique abilities. Players are only allowed one of
									each card in their deck, with the exception of basic lands,
									but they can use cards from throughout Magic's history.
								</p>
								<h4>COLOR IDENTITY</h4>
								<p>
									A card's color identity can come from any part of that card,
									including its casting cost and any mana symbols in its text.
									Every card in your Commander deck must only use mana symbols
									that also appear on your commander. Colorless cards are
									allowed as well.
								</p>
								<h4>COMMAND ZONE</h4>
								<p>
									This is where your commander resides during the game when they
									are not in play. At the start of the game, each player puts
									their commander face up into the command zone. A commander can
									be cast from the command zone for its normal costs, plus an
									additional two mana for each previous time it's been cast from
									the command zone this game. If your commander would be put
									into your library, hand, graveyard or exile from anywhere, you
									may return it to your command zone instead.
								</p>
								<h4>COMMANDER DAMAGE</h4>
								<p>
									A player that's been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the
									same commander over the course of the game loses the game. The
									commander is tracked across zone changes for this purpose (for
									example, if one player takes control of another player's
									commander, any damage that commander already dealt is still
									counted).
								</p>
								<h4>PLAY FREE-FOR-ALL MULTIPLAYER</h4>
								<p>
									If you're playing a game of Commander with three or more
									people, you play against each other in a free-for-all
									multiplayer format.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each player starts with 40 life, places their commander
									face-up in their command zone, and draws a hand of seven
									cards. Players are seated randomly in a circle and turns
									progress one player at a time in clockwise order around the
									table.
								</p>
								<p>
									During gameplay, a player may choose to attack any other
									player, regardless of their position on the table, and can
									also choose to attack multiple different players during their
									attack phase. Permanents, spells, and abilities can also
									target any player around the table (as long as they don't
									explicitly say they must be used on "you").
								</p>
								<p>
									No matter the outcome, Commander gives players the tools to
									express themselves through strategy, skill, and a whole lot of
									deck building fun. For more information about the Commander
									format, visit

								<h3>PLAY RULES & MODIFIERS</h3>
								<p>
									A format for up to 8 players to open card packs, then play
									one-on-one games on the spot! Each deck should have at least
									40 cards and should last an average length for a game (about
									20 minutes).
								</p>
								<h4>HOW TO DRAFT</h4>
								<p>
									First, players sit around a table in a semi-circle. Each
									player then opens a booster pack and picks a single card
									without showing the other players.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each player then passes the remaining cards to the left, and
									continues drafting from the new cards they get from the player
									on their right. This continues until all of the cards in those
									packs have been distributed (drafted). Then each player opens
									a second pack, but this time, pass the pack to the right.
									After all those cards are drafted, you do the same with the
									third pack, passing to the left again. At the end, each player
									will have about 45 cards (along with any number of basic
									lands) which they can use to build a 40 card deck.

								<p>
									Players will also choose which cards with the type
									"Conspiracy" will start the game in their command zone. The
									command zone is a special area set apart from the battlefield.
									Conspiracy cards aren't permanents, and nothing can affect

								<h3>PLAY RULES & MODIFIERS</h3>
								<p>
									Oversized cards and a planar die add just the right amount of
									random fun to any multiplayer game of Magic!
								</p>
								<h4>SHARED PLANAR DECK</h4>
								<p>
									Start a multiplayer game and reveal the top card of the shared
									planar deck. That is the plane that everybody is on, and its
									effects apply to all players. During each player's main phase,
									they may roll the six-sided planar die for a chance to take an
									action: If it lands on the planeswalker symbol the players
									must planeswalk and move on to the next plane - put the
									current plane on the bottom of the planar deck and reveal the
									next one.
								</p>
								<p>
									If it lands on the Chaos symbol, that player must trigger the
									Chaos ability of the plane. The first roll each turn is free,
									but if the player wants to roll the planar die more than once,
									they must pay (1) additional for each dice roll - the second
									roll each turn costs (1), the third roll costs (2), and so on.
								</p>
								<div class="planechase-img">
									<img
										src="../assets/images/formats/format-planechase.png"
										alt="#"
									/>
								</div>
								<h4>INDIVIDUAL PLANAR DECK</h4>
								<p>
									The first player gets to reveal the first plane from their own
									deck, and when anybody rolls the planeswalker symbol, they
									move on to the top plane of their own Planar deck. All other
									rules remain the same.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										A shared planar deck must contain at least 40 cards, or at
										least 10x the number of players in the game, whichever
										number is smaller;
									</li>
									<li>
										A shared planar deck also cannot contain more phenomenon
										cards than 2x the number of players in the game;
									</li>
									<li>
										Individual planar decks should contain at least 10 cards,
										including no more than 2 phenomenon cards. Either way, each
										card in a Planar deck must have a different name - you may
										not have multiple copies of the same plane or phenomenon in
										the same Planar deck;

								<h3>PLAY RULES & MODIFIERS</h3>
								<p>
									Oathbreaker is a multiplayer format where each player builds
									around their favorite Planeswalker. Each player’s deck
									consists of 60 total cards as follows:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>1 Oathbreaker (a Planeswalker card);</li>
									<li>1 Signature Spell (an instant or sorcery card);</li>
									<li>58 maindeck cards;</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Every card in a player’s deck, including their Signature
									Spell, must match the color identity of their Oathbreaker.
									With the exception of basic lands, players are only allowed
									one of each card in their deck. Cards from all sets in Magic’s
									history are legal.
								</p>
								<h4>COLOR IDENTITY</h4>
								<p>
									The colors of the symbols in the mana cost of your
									Oathbreaker, plus any mana symbols in its rule text, define
									your deck’s color identity. Every card in your deck, including
									your Signature Spell, must only use mana symbols that also
									appear on your Oathbreaker. Colorless cards are allowed as
									well.
								</p>
								<h4>COMMAND ZONE</h4>
								<p>
									You’ll have access to your Oathbreaker and Signature Spell
									from the beginning of each game. When you start a game of
									Oathbreaker, put your Oathbreaker and Signature Spell face up
									into the command zone.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can cast your Oathbreaker from the command zone for its
									normal costs, plus an additional two mana for each previous
									time it’s been cast from the command zone this game. If your
									Oathbreaker would be put into your library, hand, graveyard,
									or exile from anywhere, you may return it to your command zone
									instead.
								</p>
								<p>
									If your Oathbreaker is on the battlefield under your control,
									you can cast your Signature Spell for its normal costs, plus
									an additional two mana for each previous time you’ve cast your
									Signature Spell from the command zone this game. When your
									Signature Spell resolves, put it into the command zone instead
									of your graveyard. If your Signature Spell would go anywhere
									besides the command zone or the stack, you must put it into
									the command zone instead.
								</p>
								<h4>PLAY FREE-FOR-ALL MULTIPLAYER</h4>
								<p>
									Oathbreaker is usually played in free-for-all multiplayer
									games of three to five players.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each player starts with 20 life. Before the game begins,
									players should sit randomly in a circle and place their
									Oathbreaker and Signature Spell face-up in their command zone.
									Turns progress one player at a time in clockwise order around
									the table.
								</p>
								<p>
									During gameplay, a player may choose to attack any other
									player, regardless of their position on the table, and can
									also choose to attack multiple different players during their
									attack phase. Permanents, spells, and abilities can also
									target any player around the table (as long as they don't
									explicitly say they must be used on "you"). A player wins when
									all other players are eliminated from the game.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you’re excited to find out what happens when your favorite
									Planeswalkers battle it out, or if you’re looking for a new
									and exciting deckbuilding challenge, Oathbreaker is the right
									format for you.
								</p>

							<h2>TEAM BOOSTER DRAFT</h2>
							<div class="format-rules">
								<h3>PLAY RULES & MODIFIERS</h3>
								<p>
									Grab two friends and battle against another team of three for
									1v1 games! Seating arrangement for this format consists of two
									teams (Team A and Team B) each with three players, seating
									alternates between the teams as you go around the table. No
									communication, verbal or non-verbal, is allowed between
									players during the draft.
								</p>
								<p>
									Gameplay follows standard draft rules: Players sit around a
									table in a semi-circle. Each player then opens a booster pack
									and picks a single card without showing the other players.
									Each player then passes the remaining cards to the left, and
									continues drafting from the new cards they get from the player
									on their right. This continues until all of the cards in those
									packs have been distributed (drafted). Then each player opens
									a second pack, but this time, pass the pack to the right.
									After all those cards are drafted, you do the same with the
									third pack, passing to the left again. At the end, each player
									will have about 45 cards (along with any number of basic
									lands) which they can use to build a 40 card deck.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Minimum 40 cards per deck;</li>
									<li>
										30 min game duration for draft, 30 minutes to build, then
