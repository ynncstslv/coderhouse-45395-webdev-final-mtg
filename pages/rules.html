						<h2>GAME ACTIONS</h2>
						<p>
							This section describes the actions that you’ll take during a game,
							including tapping your cards, casting spells, and attacking and
							blocking with creatures in combat.
						</p>
						<div class="game-actions-info">
							<h3>TAPPING AND UNTAPPING</h3>
							<p>
								To tap a card is to turn it sideways to show that it has been
								used for the turn. You do this when you use a land to make mana,
								when you attack with a creature, or when you activate an ability
								that has the symbol as part of its cost ( means "tap this
								permanent"). When a permanent is tapped, you can’t tap it again
								until it’s been untapped (turned back upright). As your turn
								begins, untap your tapped cards so you can use them again.
							</p>
							<h3>CASTING SPELLS</h3>
							<p>
								To cast a spell, you must pay its mana cost (located in the
								upper right corner of the card) by tapping lands (or other
								permanents) to make the amount and Game Actions type of mana
								which that spell requires. For example, if you were casting
								Serra Angel, which costs , you could tap three basic lands of
								any type to pay plus two Plains to pay .
							</p>
							<p>
								Once a spell has been cast, one of two things happens. If the
								spell is an instant or a sorcery, you follow the instructions on
								the card, and then you put the card into your graveyard. If the
								spell is a creature, artifact, or enchantment, you put the card
								on the table in front of you. The card is now on the
								battlefield.
							</p>
							<p>
								Cards on the battlefield are called permanents to differentiate
								them from instants and sorceries, which are never on the
								battlefield.
							</p>
							<img src="#" alt="#" />
							<h3>ATTACKING AND BLOCKING</h3>
							<p>
								The most common way to win the game is to attack with your
								creatures. If a creature that is attacking an opponent isn’t
								blocked, it deals damage equal to its power to that opponent.
							</p>
							<p>
								The middle phase of each turn is the combat phase. In your
								combat phase, you choose which of your creatures will attack,
								and you choose which opponents they will attack. Tap your
								creatures to show that they are attacking. Your opponents then
								choose which of their creatures will block, if any. Tapped
								creatures can’t be declared as blockers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once all blockers have been chosen, each creature—both attackers
								and blockers—simultaneously deals damage equal to its power (the
								number on the left side of the slash in the lower right corner
								of the card).
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									An attacking creature that isn’t blocked deals damage to the
									player it’s attacking.
								</li>
								<li>
									An attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to the
									creature or creatures that are blocking it, and vice versa.
								</li>
								<li>
									If damage is dealt to your opponent, they lose that much life.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								If one of your attacking creatures is blocked by multiple
								creatures, you decide how to divide its combat damage among
								them. You must assign at least enough damage to the first
								blocking creature to destroy it before you can assign damage to
								the second one, and so on.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a creature is dealt damage equal to or greater than its
								toughness over the course of a single turn (whether it be combat
								damage, damage from spells or abilities, or a combination of
								both), that creature is destroyed, and it goes to its owner’s
								graveyard (or "dies"). If a creature takes damage that isn’t
								enough to destroy it in a single turn, that creature stays on
								the battlefield, and the damage wears off at the end of the
								turn.
							</p>
							<img src="#" alt="#" />
							<p>
								In this example, Dwarven Priest is attacking, and you have two
								creatures that can block. When you block one attacker with two
								or more creatures, your opponent must choose the order in which
								your blockers will take damage. Remember, the attacking player
								always chooses the order in which blocking creatures receive
								damage.
							</p>
							<p>
								Reclamation Sage and Giant Spider will deal a total of 4 damage
								to Dwarven Priest, which is enough to destroy it. Meanwhile,
								Dwarven Priest can deal enough damage to destroy Reclamation
								Sage, but not enough to destroy Giant Spider. Since your
								opponent’s Dwarven Priest will be destroyed in either case, they
								order Reclamation Sage before Giant Spider so that at least one
								of your creatures will be destroyed.
							</p>
							<img src="#" alt="#" />
							<p>
								Once blockers have been ordered, damage is dealt. Dwarven Priest
								deals 1 damage to Reclamation Sage, destroying it, then deals
								its remaining 1 damage to Giant Spider.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="advanced-topics-container">
							<h2>ADVANCED TOPICS</h2>
							<p>
								One of the most fun and interesting aspects of the Magic game is
								the tremendous number of unique cards you can play with, which
								in turn provide an incredibly wide range of things that could
								happen in any given game. This section is a reference for when
								you need to know more details about the rules of Magic.
							</p>
							<div class="advanced-topics-info">
								<h3>TARGETING</h3>
								<p>
									Some spells and abilities use the word "target" to describe
									something that the spell or ability will affect. You must
									choose all targets for a spell when you cast it, and for an
									ability when it triggers or when you activate it. If you can’t
									meet the targeting requirements, you can’t cast the spell or
									use the ability. For example, if a spell has the text "Destroy
									target creature," but there are no creatures on the
									battlefield, you can’t cast that spell because it has no valid
									targets.
								</p>
								<p>
									If a spell "deals damage to any target," you can choose any
									creature or player (or planeswalker, if a player has one) as a
									target for that spell.
								</p>
								<p>
									Once you choose targets, you can’t change your mind later.
									When the spell or ability resolves, it checks the targets to
									make sure they’re still legal (that is, they’re still there
									and they still match the requirements of the spell or
									ability). If a target isn’t legal, the spell or ability can’t
									affect it. If none of the targets are legal, the spell or
									ability does nothing at all.
								</p>
								<h3>THE STACK</h3>
								<p>
									The stack is a game zone shared by all players (like the
									battlefield) where spells and abilities wait to resolve.
									Resolving a spell or ability simply means that its effect
									happens.
								</p>
								<div class="stack-info">
									<h4>USING THE STACK</h4>
									<p>
										When you cast a spell or activate an ability, it doesn’t
										resolve right away—it goes on the stack. Spells and
										abilities remain on the stack until both players choose not
										to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities.
										Triggered abilities also go on the stack until they resolve.
									</p>
									<p>
										When you have finished putting spells and abilities on the
										stack, priority then passes to the next player in turn
										order, who may want to use a spell or ability of their own
										in response. Subsequent players (including you) can then
										respond to that player’s response, and so on—the result is a
										"stack" waiting to resolve. Spells and abilities remain on
										the stack until all players choose not to cast any new
										spells or activate any new abilities.
									</p>
									<p>
										<em
											>A general rule is that spells and abilities on the stack
											resolve one by one, beginning with the last one put on the
											stack.</em
										>
									</p>
									<h4>RESPONDING TO SPELLS AND ABILITIES</h4>
									<p>
										When you cast a spell or activate an ability, it doesn’t
										resolve right away—it goes on the stack. Spells and
										abilities remain on the stack until both players choose not
										to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities.
										Triggered abilities also go on the stack until they resolve.
									</p>
									<p>
										Each player has an opportunity to cast an instant spell (or
										activate an activated ability) in response to any spell or
										ability that goes on the stack. If a player does decide to
										respond, their spell or ability goes on the stack on top of
										what was already waiting there. When all players pass—that
										is, decline to do anything more—the top spell or ability on
										the stack will resolve.
									</p>
									<img src="#" alt="#" />
									<p>
										After a spell or ability resolves, both players again get
										the chance to respond. If no one does, the next thing
										waiting on the stack will resolve. If the stack is empty,
										the current step of the turn will end, and the game will
										proceed to the next step.
									</p>
									<h4>EXAMPLE OF SPELLS ON THE STACK</h4>
									<p>
										Your opponent casts Shock targeting your Eager Construct, a
										2/2 creature. Shock goes on the stack. You respond to Shock
										by casting Titanic Growth. Titanic Growth goes on the stack
										on top of Shock. You and your opponent both decline to do
										anything else.
									</p>
									<p>
										Your opponent casts Shock targeting your Eager Construct, a
										2/2 creature. Shock goes on the stack. You respond to Shock
										by casting Titanic Growth. Titanic Growth goes on the stack
										on top of Shock. You and your opponent both decline to do
										anything else.
									</p>
									<p>
										Titanic Growth resolves, making Eager Construct a 6/6 until
										the end of the turn. Then Shock resolves and deals 2 damage
										to the pumped-up Eager Construct, which is not enough to
										destroy it.
									</p>
									<img src="#" alt="#" />
									<p>
										<b>What would happen if Titanic Growth were cast first?</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										The Shock would go on the stack on top of Titanic Growth,
										which means it would resolve first this time. Shock would
										still deal 2 damage to Eager Construct, but this time that
										damage is being dealt before Titanic Growth can resolve and
										take effect—so 2 damage is enough to destroy Eager
										Construct!

				<h1>PARTS OF THE TURN</h1>
				<p>
					Each turn proceeds in the same sequence. Whenever you enter a new step
					or phase, any triggered abilities that happen during that step or
					phase trigger and are put on the stack. The active player (the player
					whose turn it is) gets to start casting spells and activating
					abilities, then each other player in turn order will too. When all
					players decline to do anything more and nothing is on the stack
					waiting to resolve, the game will move to the next step.
				</p>
				<img src="#" alt="#" />
				<article class="parts-info">
					<div class="untap-step">
						<h2>UNTAP STEP</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span>Untap step:</span>You untap all your tapped permanents. On
								the first turn of the game, you don’t have any permanents, so
								you just skip this step. No one can cast spells or activate
								abilities during this step.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>Upkeep step:</span> Players can cast instants and activate
								abilities. This part of the turn is mentioned on a number of
								cards. If something is supposed to happen just once per turn,
								right at the beginning, an ability will trigger "at the
								beginning of your upkeep."
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>Draw step:</span> You must draw a card from your library
								(even if you don’t want to). The player who goes first in a
								two-player game skips the draw step on their first turn to make
								up for the advantage of going first. Players can then cast
								instants and activate abilities.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="first-main">
						<h2>FIRST MAIN PHASE</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								You can cast any number of sorceries, instants, creatures,
								artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers, and you can activate
								abilities. You can play a land during this phase, but remember
								that you can play only one land during your turn. Your opponent
								can cast instants and activate abilities.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="combat-step">
						<h2>COMBAT STEP</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span>Beginning of combat step:</span> Players can cast instants
								and activate abilities.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>Declare attackers step:</span> You decide which, if any,
								of your untapped creatures will attack, and which player or
								planeswalker they will attack. This taps the attacking
								creatures. Players can then cast instants and activate
								abilities.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>Declare blockers step:</span> Your opponent decides which,
								if any, of their untapped creatures will block your attacking
								creatures. If multiple creatures block a single attacker, you
								order the blockers to show which will be first to receive
								damage, which will be second, and so on. Players can then cast
								instants and activate abilities.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>Combat damage step:</span> Each attacking or blocking
								creature that’s still on the battlefield assigns its combat
								damage to the defending player (if it’s attacking that player
								and wasn’t blocked), to a planeswalker (if it’s attacking that
								planeswalker and wasn’t blocked), to the creature or creatures
								blocking it, or to the creature it’s blocking. If an attacking
								creature is blocked by multiple creatures, you divide its combat
								damage among them by assigning at least enough damage to the
								first blocking creature to destroy it, then by assigning damage
								to the second one, and so on. Once players decide how the
								creatures they control will deal their combat damage, the damage
								is all dealt at the same time. Players can then cast instants
								and activate abilities.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>End of combat step:</span> Players can cast instants and
								activate abilities.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="second-main">
						<h2>SECOND MAIN PHASE</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Your second main phase is just like your first main phase. You
								can cast any type of spell and activate abilities, but your
								opponent can only cast instants and activate abilities. You can
								play a land during this phase if you didn’t play one during your
								first main phase.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="ending-phase">
						<h2>ENDING PHASE</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span>End step:</span> Abilities that trigger “at the beginning
								of your end step” go on the stack. Players can cast instants and
								activate abilities.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span>Cleanup step:</span> If you have more than seven cards in
								your hand, choose and discard cards until you have only seven.
								Next, all damage on creatures is removed and all “until end of
								turn” effects end. No one can cast instants or activate
								abilities unless an ability triggers during this step.
